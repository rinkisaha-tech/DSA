## Introduction to DSA
- **What is DSA?**
  - Importance of DSA in problem-solving
  - Applications in real-world systems

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Big O, Big Theta, and Big Omega notations
  - Best case, worst case, and average case analysis
  - Complexity of common operations (e.g., loops, recursive calls)
  
- **Space Complexity:**
  - Memory usage in algorithms

### Example: Time Complexity of a Loop

```java
// O(n) - Time Complexity
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```
